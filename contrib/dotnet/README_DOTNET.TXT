Subject: 	.net bindings for MiTab

Hello Daniel,

I have made use of your MITAB dll in my MapObjects based application. 
Thank you for the making the package available. It has proved useful.

My application is in C#, so to use MITAB I created a set of .net 
bindings. I also created a basic object model proving feature only 
access to the fields, features, parts and vertices in a layer.

I've attached my source in the hope that it may be of some use to 
others. I must point out that I've not undertaken extensive testing. The 
MITAB calls that I use in my object model do work perfectly (for me at 
least).

BTW, I'm not sure that I've used the most efficient approach here. It 
may have been wiser to build the .net bindings directly onto the C++ API?

Best wishes,

Graham Sims
