MITAB Library - Revision History
================================

ToDo - Known problems:
----------------------

 - OGRTABDataSource: Need to be able to open all files from a directory

 - Can we do anything for optimized spatial searches in TAB files?
   (i.e. See SetSpatialFilter())

 - Support for bForceFlag incomplete in GetBounds(), GetFeatureCount()
   and GetFeatureCountByType() in MIFFile.

 - Since we are not guaranteed that MapInfo REGIONs are topologically 
   correct polygons with one outer ring and a set of inner rings, should
   we return REGIONs as OGRMultiPolygons instead?

 - API Documentation

 - TABView support:
     - Complete and tested only for cases in which 2 tables
       are linked with a many-to-1 relation through an integer field.  
       Still need to support encoding index key for float fields and to 
       test with a bigger set of TABView files.
     - The merge operation involves 3 features in memory and cloning the
       geometry... this could perhaps be optimized but would require changes
       at the lower-level in the lib.
     - What is the proper behavior when no record in RelTable for a feature
       from MainTable?  For now we leave fields unset

 - TABINDNode:
     - Need to find out the way float keys are encoded and to add support
       for them.

Current Version:
----------------

 - Added TABView class to support views on pairs of .TAB files (read-only)
    - Currently supports only 2 tables with a many-to-1 relation through
      an integer field.

 - Added GetFeatureCountByType() method.  Current implementation does
   not work (returns all zeros) for MIF files

 - Added static ImapInfoFile::SmartOpen() to automatically detect file type,
   open a new file for read and return a new object of the appropriate
   type (TABFile/TABView/MIFFile) to handle it.

 - Changed TABFile::Open(), MIFFile::Open() to use a bTestOpenNoError flag

 - OGRMIDDataSource/OGRMIDDriver were removed.  Now all file types
   handled by MITAB go through the OGRTABDataSource/OGRTABDriver interface

 - Fixed problem reading/writing dates (bytes were reversed)

Version 0.1 - (1999-12-04)
--------------------------

 - First official pre-release version

 - Still lacks good API docs.
