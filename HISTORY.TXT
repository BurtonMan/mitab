MITAB Library - Revision History
================================

ToDo - Open Questions:
----------------------

 - OGRTABDataSource: Need to be able to open all files from a directory

 - Can we do anything for optimized spatial searches in TAB files?
   (i.e. See SetSpatialFilter())

 - API Documentation

 - TABView support:
     - Complete and tested only for cases in which 2 tables
       are linked with a many-to-1 relation through an integer field.  
       Still need to support encoding index key for float fields and to 
       test with a bigger set of TABView files.
     - The merge operation involves 3 features in memory and cloning the
       geometry... this could perhaps be optimized but would require changes
       at the lower-level in the lib.
     - What is the proper behavior when no record in RelTable for a feature
       from MainTable?  For now we leave fields unset

 - TABINDNode:
     - Need to find out the way float keys are encoded and to add support
       for them.

 - ??? Produce a Warning when bounds not set on first SetFeature()

 - What to do about m_dCoordsys2DistUnits in both read and write.

 - TABMAPObjBlocks could be split during write when they're full in order to
   optimize spatial index.  Files are still usable even without this kind 
   of optimization.

 - ARC angles: 
   - When x axis is flipped, why do we have to read End before start angle?
     (Actually, angle order always seem to be reversed no matter which 
      quadrant the file is in.)
   - What is the correct conversion for angles based on quadrant?
   - Bizarre: arcs.tab is in quadrant 2, but byte 0x162 (FlipXAxis) = 0 !!!


CHANGES - Current Version:
--------------------------


Version 0.2 - (1999-12-20)
--------------------------

 - Added TABView class to support views on pairs of .TAB files (read-only)
    - Currently supports only 2 tables with a many-to-1 relation through
      an integer field.

 - Added GetFeatureCountByType() method.  Current implementation does
   not work (returns all zeros) for MIF files

 - Added static ImapInfoFile::SmartOpen() to automatically detect file type,
   open a new file for read and return a new object of the appropriate
   type (TABFile/TABView/MIFFile) to handle it.

 - Changed TABFile::Open(), MIFFile::Open() to use a bTestOpenNoError flag

 - OGRMIDDataSource/OGRMIDDriver were removed.  Now all file types
   handled by MITAB go through the OGRTABDataSource/OGRTABDriver interface

 - Fixed problem reading/writing dates (bytes were reversed)
        Also, Dates are now returned as "YYYYMMDD", and accepted as one
        of "YYYY/MM/DD", "DD/MM/YYYY", or "YYYYMMDD"

 - Fixed TABFile::GetBounds() that could sometimes return Min values > Max

 - Rounded rectangles with radius bigger than MBR: we used to return a
   corrected radius value, but it's now changed to return the real radius
   value (even if it's too big) since this is what MapInfo appears to do
   when exporting from TAB to MIF

 - Fixed some problems that had appeared following a change in OGR's
   addGeometry()... use the new addGeometryDirectly() + more error checking.

 - TABRegions geometry now returned as OGRMultiPolygon instead of OGRPolygon
   with multiple rings.  This change had to be done because OGRPolygons
   MUST have only one outer ring with a set of inner rings, and this
   cannot be guaranteed to be the case with a MapInfo file.
   Also added TABRegion::GetNumRings() and TABRegion::GetRing() to 
   make it simpler to manipulate the complex geometry as if it was a 
   simple collection of rings which is actually what we have in the 
   MapInfo model.

 - Fixed some problems with MIF generation of Float fields and PLINE MULTIPLE

 - Run a bunch of read/write tests for both .TAB and .MIF through Purify...
   fixed all memory leaks found.

Version 0.1 - (1999-12-04)
--------------------------

 - First official pre-release version

 - Still lacks good API docs.
